In this project I will be making the card game War.

It is a two player card game using a deck of 52 cards (normal deck)

Objective:

Be the first person to win ALL of the cards (i.e. if you finish your stack you lose)

How to play:

1. The card gets equally split between the two players
2. Together, the players reveal the top card of their deck
3. The player with the highest card wins and take both cards into their deck
    (Aces are highest)
    If two players show a card of the same value (e.g. 7 and 7):
        Both players now put forward 2 cards
        The top card is face down and the next card is face up
        Compare the face up cards
        Whoever wins collect all the cards (in this case 4)
        If its another draw, continue the process of placing one face down and one face up

To make this game:
1. Make a card class
2. Make a deck class
3. Make a player class
4. Make the game logic

Note:
This game will be simulated, i.e. no active players

Focus:
1. OOP programming
2. Unit Testing
3. Pylint to make code neat
